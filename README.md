## About
Repea is a language learning app that allows users to practice speaking any language through [shadowing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_shadowing). Shadowing is a language learning technique which can be very effective in improving one's speaking ability. The concept is simple, listen to conversations in the language you are studying and repeat what is said in real time. However, sometimes native conversations can be too fast for language learners to understand. Repea represents a simple way for people to slow down conversations to practice with, while increasing the speed over time to improve.

## Features
The app lets you:
- Access and play audio files on your phone
- Adjust the speed to suit your speaking level
- Record conversations from your favorite anime, television show, or movie to practice with (coming soon)

## Current issues
- Upon first installation, the song list doesn't show up for some. Simply restart the app and the songs will be displayed properly from then on
